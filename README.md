# Knight's Tour Problem

The Knight's Tour is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, where the objective is to move a knight across a chessboard such that it visits every square exactly once. This repository offers an implementation of this problem in C#, utilizing the backtracking algorithm to find a solution.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Employs a depth-first search approach to explore all possible knight moves, backtracking when a move leads to a dead end.
- **Chessboard Size Flexibility**: Allows users to define the dimensions of the chessboard, supporting various sizes beyond the standard 8x8.
- **Customizable Starting Position**: Enables users to set the knight's initial position on the board.

## Getting Started

To run the Knight's Tour program:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmirAbdollahi/knight-tour.git
   ```
îˆ†

2. **Open the Solution**:

   Navigate to the cloned directory and open `Knight Tour.sln` using Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.

3. **Build the Solution**:

   Compile the project to restore dependencies and build the executable.

4. **Run the Program**:

   Execute the program within your development environment or run the compiled executable from the command line.

## Usage

Upon running the program, it will prompt you to enter the dimensions of the chessboard and the starting position of the knight. The program will then attempt to find a solution to the Knight's Tour problem using the backtracking algorithm.
